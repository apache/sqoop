Importing Data Into Phoenix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sqoop supports additional import targets beyond HDFS and Hive. Sqoop
can also import records into a table in Phoenix.

By specifying +\--phoenix-table+, you instruct Sqoop to import
to a table in Phoenix backed Hbase rather than a directory in HDFS. Sqoop will
import data to the table specified as the argument to +\--phoenix-table+.

NOTE: This function is incompatible with direct import (parameter 
+\--direct+).

If the column names in the input table differ from the column names
in Phoenix, specify +\--phoenix-column-mapping+. The argument is a 
comma-separated list of input column name and phoenix column name . The 
two should be separated by a ;. 
Ex: sqoop_col1;phoenix_col1,sqoop_col2;phoenix_col2..
The mapper transforms each row of the input table into an upsert
into Phoenix and persists using PhoenixOutputFormat. 


If the target Phoenix table do not exist, the Sqoop job will
exit with an error. You should create the target table before running an import. 

To decrease the load on hbase, Sqoop can do bulk loading as opposed to
direct writes. To use bulk loading, enable it using +\--phoenix-bulkload+.

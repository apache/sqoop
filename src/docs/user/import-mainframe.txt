+sqoop-import-mainframe+
------------------------

Purpose
~~~~~~~

Syntax
~~~~~~

----
$ sqoop import-mainframe (generic-args) (import-args)
$ sqoop-import-mainframe (generic-args) (import-args)
----

While the Hadoop generic arguments must precede any import arguments,
you can type the import arguments in any order with respect to one
another.

Selecting the Files to Import
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use the +\--dataset+ argument to specify a partitioned dataset name.
All sequential datasets in the partitioned dataset will be imported.

Controlling Parallelism
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sqoop imports data in parallel by making multiple ftp connections to the
mainframe to transfer multiple files simultaneously.  You can specify the
number of map tasks (parallel processes) to use to perform the import by
using the +-m+ or +\--num-mappers+ argument. Each of these arguments
takes an integer value which corresponds to the degree of parallelism
to employ. By default, four tasks are used. You can adjust this value to
maximize the data transfer rate from the mainframe.

include::distributed-cache.txt[]

Controlling the Import Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, Sqoop will import all sequential files in a partitioned dataset
+pds+ to a directory named +pds+ inside your home directory in HDFS. For
example, if your username is +someuser+, then the import tool will write to
+/user/someuser/pds/(files)+. You can adjust the parent directory of
the import with the +\--warehouse-dir+ argument. For example:

----
$ sqoop import-mainframe --connnect <host> --dataset foo --warehouse-dir /shared \
    ...
----

This command would write to a set of files in the +/shared/pds/+ directory.

You can also explicitly choose the target directory, like so:

----
$ sqoop import-mainframe --connnect <host> --dataset foo --target-dir /dest \
    ...
----

This will import the files into the +/dest+ directory. +\--target-dir+ is
incompatible with +\--warehouse-dir+.

By default, imports go to a new target location. If the destination directory
already exists in HDFS, Sqoop will refuse to import and overwrite that
directory's contents.

File Formats
^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, each record in a dataset is stored
as a text record with a newline at the end.  Each record is assumed to contain
a single text field with the name DEFAULT_COLUMN.
When Sqoop imports data to HDFS, it generates a Java class which can
reinterpret the text files that it creates.

You can also import mainframe records to Sequence, Avro, or Parquet files.

By default, data is not compressed. You can compress your data by
using the deflate (gzip) algorithm with the +-z+ or +\--compress+
argument, or specify any Hadoop compression codec using the
+\--compression-codec+ argument.

include::output-args.txt[]

Since mainframe record contains only one field, importing to delimited files
will not contain any field delimiter.  However, the field may be enclosed with
enclosing character or escaped by an escaping character.

include::input-args.txt[]

When Sqoop imports data to HDFS, it generates a Java class which can
reinterpret the text files that it creates when doing a
delimited-format import. The delimiters are chosen with arguments such
as +\--fields-terminated-by+; this controls both how the data is
written to disk, and how the generated +parse()+ method reinterprets
this data. The delimiters used by the +parse()+ method can be chosen
independently of the output arguments, by using
+\--input-fields-terminated-by+, and so on. This is useful, for example, to
generate classes which can parse records created with one set of
delimiters, and emit the records to a different set of files using a
separate set of delimiters.

As mentioned earlier, a byproduct of importing a table to HDFS is a
class which can manipulate the imported data.
You should use this class in your subsequent
MapReduce processing of the data.

The class is typically named after the partitioned dataset name; a
partitioned dataset named +foo+ will
generate a class named +foo+. You may want to override this class
name. For example, if your partitioned dataset
is named +EMPLOYEES+, you may want to
specify +\--class-name Employee+ instead. Similarly, you can specify
just the package name with +\--package-name+. The following import
generates a class named +com.foocorp.SomePDS+:

----
$ sqoop import-mainframe --connect <host> --dataset SomePDS --package-name com.foocorp
----

The +.java+ source file for your class will be written to the current
working directory when you run +sqoop+. You can control the output
directory with +\--outdir+. For example, +\--outdir src/generated/+.

The import process compiles the source into +.class+ and +.jar+ files;
these are ordinarily stored under +/tmp+. You can select an alternate
target directory with +\--bindir+. For example, +\--bindir /scratch+.

If you already have a compiled class that can be used to perform the
import and want to suppress the code-generation aspect of the import
process, you can use an existing jar and class by
providing the +\--jar-file+ and +\--class-name+ options. For example:

----
$ sqoop import-mainframe --dataset SomePDS --jar-file mydatatypes.jar \
    --class-name SomePDSType
----

This command will load the +SomePDSType+ class out of +mydatatypes.jar+.

Additional Import Configuration Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are some additional properties which can be configured by modifying
+conf/sqoop-site.xml+. Properties can be specified the same as in Hadoop
configuration files, for example:

----
  <property>
    <name>property.name</name>
    <value>property.value</value>
  </property>
----

They can also be specified on the command line in the generic arguments, for
example:

----
sqoop import -D property.name=property.value ...
----

Example Invocations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following examples illustrate how to use the import tool in a variety
of situations.

A basic import of all sequential files in a partitioned dataset named
+EMPLOYEES+ in the mainframe host z390:

----
$ sqoop import-mainframe --connect z390 --dataset EMPLOYEES \
    --username SomeUser -P
Enter password: (hidden)
----

Controlling the import parallelism (using 8 parallel tasks):

----
$ sqoop import-mainframe --connect z390 --dataset EMPLOYEES \
    --username SomeUser --password-file mypassword -m 8
----

Importing the data to Hive:

----
$ sqoop import-mainframe --connect z390 --dataset EMPLOYEES \
    --hive-import
----

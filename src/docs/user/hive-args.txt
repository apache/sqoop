.Hive arguments:
[grid="all"]
`-----------------------------`-------------------------------------------
Argument                      Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
+\--hive-home <dir>+          Override +$HIVE_HOME+
+\--hive-import+              Import tables into Hive (Uses Hive's \
                              default delimiters if none are set.)
+\--hive-overwrite+           Overwrite existing data in the Hive table.
+\--create-hive-table+        If set, then the job will fail if the target hive
                              table exists. By default this property is false.
+\--hive-table <table-name>+  Sets the table name to use when importing\
                              to Hive.
+\--hive-drop-import-delims+  Drops '\n', '\r', and '\01' from string\
                  fields when importing to Hive.
+\--hive-delims-replacement+  Replace '\n', '\r', and '\01' from string\
                  fields with user defined string when importing to Hive.
+\--hive-partition-key+       Name of a hive field to partition are \
                  sharded on

+\--map-column-hive <map>+    Override default mapping from SQL type to\
                  Hive type for configured columns. If specify commas in\
                  this argument, use URL encoded keys and values, for example,\
                  use DECIMAL(1%2C%201) instead of DECIMAL(1, 1). Note that in case of Parquet file format users have\
                  to use +\--map-column-java+ instead of this option.
+\--hs2-url+                  The JDBC connection string to HiveServer2 as you would specify in Beeline. If you use this option with \
                    --hive-import then Sqoop will try to connect to HiveServer2 instead of using Hive CLI.
+\--hs2-user+                 The user for creating the JDBC connection to HiveServer2. The default is the current OS user.
+\--hs2-password+             The password for creating the JDBC connection to HiveServer2. If not specified, kerberos\

+\--external-table-dir+       Used to specify that the table is external, not managed. \
                              Has to be specified with the +\--hive-import+ option.

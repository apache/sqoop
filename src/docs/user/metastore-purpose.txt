The +metastore+ tool configures Sqoop to host a shared Hsqldb metadata repository.
Multiple users and/or remote users can define and execute saved jobs (created
with +sqoop job+) defined in this metastore.

Clients must be configured to connect to the metastore in +sqoop-site.xml+ or
with the +--meta-connect+ argument. These commands MySql, Hsqldb, PostgreSql, Oracle, DB2,
and SqlServer databases as well. All services other than Hsqldb and Postgres require the
download of the corresponding JDBC driver and connect string structured in the correct format.

Migration of metastore data from one database service to another is not directly supported, but is possible.

The +metastore+ tool configures Sqoop to host a shared metadata repository.
Multiple users and/or remote users can define and execute saved jobs (created
with +sqoop job+) defined in this metastore.

Clients must be configured to connect to the metastore in +sqoop-site.xml+ or
with the +--meta-connect+ argument.

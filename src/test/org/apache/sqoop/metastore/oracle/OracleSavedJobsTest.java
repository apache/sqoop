/**
 * Test of GenericJobStorage compatibility with Oracle
 *
 * This uses JDBC to store and retrieve metastore data from an Oracle server
 *
 * Since this requires an Oracle installation,
 * this class is named in such a way that Sqoop's default QA process does
 * not run it. You need to run this manually with
 * -Dtestcase=OracleSavedJobsTest or -Dthirdparty=true.
 *
 * You need to put Oracle JDBC driver library (ojdbc6.jar) in a location
 * where Sqoop will be able to access it (since this library cannot be checked
 * into Apache's tree for licensing reasons) and set it's path through -Dsqoop.thirdparty.lib.dir.
 *
 *   Once you have a running Oracle database,
 *   Set server URL, username, and password with system variables
 *   -Dsqoop.test.oracle.connectstring, -Dsqoop.test.oracle.username
 *   and -Dsqoop.test.oracle.password respectively

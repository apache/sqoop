/**
 * Test that Incremental-Import values are stored correctly in DB2
 *
 * This uses JDBC to store and retrieve metastore data from a DB2 server
 *
 * Since this requires a DB2 installation,
 * this class is named in such a way that Sqoop's default QA process does
 * not run it. You need to run this manually with
 * -Dtestcase=DB2MetaConnectIncrementalImportTest or -Dthirdparty=true.
 *
 * You need to put DB2 JDBC driver library (db2jcc4.jar) in a location
 * where Sqoop will be able to access it (since this library cannot be checked
 * into Apache's tree for licensing reasons) and set it's path through -Dsqoop.thirdparty.lib.dir.
 *
 *   Once you have a running DB2 database,
 *   Set server URL, database name, username, and password with system variables
 *   -Dsqoop.test.db2.connectstring.host_url, -Dsqoop.test.db2.connectstring.database,
 *   -Dsqoop.test.db2.connectstring.username and -Dsqoop.test.db2.connectstring.password respectively

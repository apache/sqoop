/**
 * Test that the Job Tool works in MySql
 *
 * This uses JDBC to store and retrieve metastore data from a MySql server
 *
 * Since this requires a MySql installation,
 * this class is named in such a way that Sqoop's default QA process does
 * not run it. You need to run this manually with
 * -Dtestcase=MySqlJobToolTest or -Dthirdparty=true.
 *
 * You need to put MySql JDBC driver library (mysql-connector-java-5.1.38-bin.jar) in a location
 * where Sqoop will be able to access it (since this library cannot be checked
 * into Apache's tree for licensing reasons) and set it's path through -Dsqoop.thirdparty.lib.dir.
 *
 *   Once you have a running MySql database,
 *   Set server URL, database name, username, and password with system variables
 *   -Dsqoop.test.mysql.connectstring.host_url, -Dsqoop.test.mysql.databasename,
 *   -Dsqoop.test.mysql.username and -Dsqoop.test.mysql.password respectively

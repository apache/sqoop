# Welcome to Sqoop!

This is the Sqoop (SQL-to-Hadoop) tool. Sqoop allows easy imports and
exports of data sets between databases and HDFS.

## More Documentation

Sqoop ships with additional documentation: a user guide and a manual page.

Asciidoc sources for both of these are in `src/docs/`. Run `ant docs` to build
the documentation. It will be created in `build/docs/`.

If you got Sqoop in release form, documentation will already be built and
available in the `docs/` directory.

For more information on compiling see  [COMPILING.adoc](COMPILING.adoc).

GNU General Public License
**************************

     	    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
     	       Version 2, June 1991
     
     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     		  675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
     
     		    Preamble
     
     The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
     freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
     License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
     software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
     General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
     Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
     using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
     the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
     your programs, too.
     
     When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
     price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
     have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
     this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
     if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
     in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
     
     To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
     anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
     These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
     distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
     
     For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
     gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
     you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
     source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
     rights.
     
     We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
     (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
     distribute and/or modify the software.
     
     Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
     that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
     software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
     want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
     that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
     authors' reputations.
     
     Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
     patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
     program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
     program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
     patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
     
     The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
     modification follow.
     
     	    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
     
     0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
     a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
     refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
     means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
     that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
     either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
     language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
     the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
     
     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
     covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
     running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
     is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
     Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
     Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
     
     1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
     and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
     along with the Program.
     
     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
     you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
     
     2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
     
     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
     
     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
     parties under the terms of this License.
     
     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
     
     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
     and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
     themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
     sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
     distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
     on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
     this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
     entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
     
     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
     your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
     exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
     collective works based on the Program.
     
     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
     with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
     the scope of this License.
     
     3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
     Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
     
     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
     
     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
     customarily used for software interchange; or,
     
     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
     received the program in object code or executable form with such
     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
     
     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
     code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
     associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
     control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
     special exception, the source code distributed need not include
     anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
     form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
     operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
     itself accompanies the executable.
     
     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
     
     4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
     However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
     this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
     parties remain in full compliance.
     
     5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
     distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
     prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
     modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
     all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
     the Program or works based on it.
     
     6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
     these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
     restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
     You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
     this License.
     
     7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
     conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
     excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
     distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
     License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
     may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
     license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
     all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
     the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
     refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
     
     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
     any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
     apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
     circumstances.
     
     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
     such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
     integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
     to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
     impose that choice.
     
     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
     be a consequence of the rest of this License.
     
     8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
     original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
     may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
     those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
     countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
     the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
     
     9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
     of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
     be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
     address new problems or concerns.
     
     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
     specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
     later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
     either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
     this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
     Foundation.
     
     10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
     to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
     Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
     make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
     of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
     of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
     
     		    NO WARRANTY
     
     11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
     FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
     OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
     PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
     OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
     TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
     REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
     
     12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
     WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
     REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
     INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
     OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
     TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
     YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
     POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
     
     	     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
     
     Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
     
     If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
     possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
     free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
     
     To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
     to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
     convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
     the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
     
     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
     Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>
     
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
     
     Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
     
     If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
     when it starts in an interactive mode:
     
     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
     
     The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
     parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
     be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
     mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
     
     You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
     school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
     necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
     
     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
     
     <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice
     
     This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
     proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
     consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
     library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
     Public License instead of this License.

MySQL FLOSS License Exception

The MySQL AB Exception for Free/Libre and Open Source
Software-only Applications Using MySQL Client Libraries (the
"FLOSS Exception").

Version 0.6, 7 March 2007

Exception Intent

We want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software (``FLOSS'')
applications to be able to use specified GPL-licensed MySQL client
libraries (the ``Program'') despite the fact that not all FLOSS
licenses are compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public
License (the ``GPL'').

Legal Terms and Conditions

As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2.0
of the GPL:

 1. You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed
    entirely from the Program and one or more works (each, a
    "FLOSS Work") licensed under one or more of the licenses
    listed below in section 1, as long as:
      a. You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and the
         Derivative Work, except for identifiable sections of the
         Derivative Work which are not derived from the Program,
         and which can reasonably be considered independent and
         separate works in themselves,
      b. all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which
         are not derived from the Program, and which can
         reasonably be considered independent and separate works
         in themselves,
           i. are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses
              listed below, and
          ii. the object code or executable form of those sections
              are accompanied by the complete corresponding
              machine-readable source code for those sections on
              the same medium and under the same FLOSS license as
              the corresponding object code or executable forms of
              those sections, and
      c. any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a
         Derivative Work on a volume of a storage or distribution
         medium in accordance with the GPL, can reasonably be
         considered independent and separate works in themselves
         which are not derivatives of either the Program, a
         Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.
    If the above conditions are not met, then the Program may only
    be copied, modified, distributed or used under the terms and
    conditions of the GPL or another valid licensing option from
    MySQL AB.

    Software Foundation's Free Software Definition
    (http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) or version 1.9 of
    the Open Source Definition by the Open Source Initiative

 3. Definitions

      a. Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the
         meaning provided in the GPL.
      b. Derivative Work means a derivative work under copyright
         law.

 4. Applicability: This FLOSS Exception applies to all Programs
    that contain a notice placed by MySQL AB saying that the
    Program may be distributed under the terms of this FLOSS
    Exception. If you create or distribute a work which is a
    Derivative Work of both the Program and any other work
    licensed under the GPL, then this FLOSS Exception is not
    available for that work; thus, you must remove the FLOSS
    Exception notice from that work and comply with the GPL in all
    respects, including by retaining all GPL notices. You may
    choose to redistribute a copy of the Program exclusively under
    the terms of the GPL by removing the FLOSS Exception notice
    from that copy of the Program, provided that the copy has
    never been modified by you or any third party.

Appendix A. Qualified Libraries and Packages

The following is a non-exhaustive list of libraries and packages
which are covered by the FLOSS License Exception. Please note that
this appendix is provided merely as an additional service to
specific FLOSS projects wishing to simplify licensing information
for their users. Compliance with one of the licenses noted under
the "FLOSS license list" section remains a prerequisite.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
               Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
the version number 2.1.]

                Preamble

 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

 This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

 For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

 We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

 To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

 We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

 A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

 The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

 "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

   b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
   charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

   d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
   table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
   the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
   is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
   in the event an application does not supply such function or
   table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
   its purpose remains meaningful.

   (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
   a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
   application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
   application-supplied function or table used by this function must
   be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
   root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

 This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

 If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

 However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

 When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

 If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

 Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

 You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

   a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
   machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
   changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
   Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
   with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
   uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
   user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
   executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
   that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
   Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
   to use the modified definitions.)

   b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
   Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
   copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
   rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
   will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
   the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
   interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

   c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
   least three years, to give the same user the materials
   specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
   than the cost of performing this distribution.

   d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
   from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
   specified materials from the same place.

   e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
   materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

 For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

 It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
   based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
   facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
   Sections above.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
   that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
   where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                NO WARRANTY

 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

          How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

 If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

 To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.


   Copyright (C)   

   This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
   modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
   License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
   version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

   This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
   Lesser General Public License for more details.

   You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
   License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
   Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

 Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
 library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

 , 1 April 1990
 Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

     Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
     copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

     "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

     "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

     designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

     "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
     on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
     subsequently incorporated within the Work.

  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
     publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
     Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
     use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
     where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
     by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
     institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
     or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
     as of the date such litigation is filed.

  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
     Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
     modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
     meet the following conditions:

     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
         Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
         stating that You changed the files; and

     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
         attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
         the Derivative Works; and

     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

7       

of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

8       

9       

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts

10      

as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence

11      

the version number 2.1.]

12      

13      

                Preamble

14      

15      

 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your

16      

freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public

17      

Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change

18      

free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

19      

20      

 This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some

21      

specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the

22      

Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You

23      

can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether

24      

this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better

25      

strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

26      

27      

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,

28      

not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that

29      

you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge

30      

for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get

31      

it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of

32      

it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do

33      

these things.

34      

35      

 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid

36      

distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these

37      

rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for

38      

you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

39      

40      

 For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis

41      

or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave

42      

you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source

43      

code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide

44      

complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them

45      

with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling

46      

it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

47      

48      

 We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the

49      

library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal

50      

permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

51      

52      

 To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that

53      

there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is

54      

modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know

55      

that what they have is not the original version, so that the original

56      

author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be

57      

introduced by others.

58      



59      

 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of

60      

any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot

61      

effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a

62      

restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that

63      

any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be

64      

consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

65      

66      

 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the

67      

ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser

68      

General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and

69      

is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use

70      

this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those

71      

libraries into non-free programs.

72      

73      

 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using

74      

a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a

75      

combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary

76      

General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the

77      

entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General

78      

Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with

79      

the library.

80      

81      

 We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it

82      

does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General

83      

Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less

84      

of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages

85      

are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many

86      

libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain

87      

special circumstances.

88      

89      

 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to

90      

encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes

91      

a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be

92      

allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free

93      

library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this

94      

case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free

95      

software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

96      

97      

 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free

98      

programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of

99      

free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in

100         

non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU

101         

operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating

102         

system.

103         

104         

 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the

105         

users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is

106         

linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run

107         

that program using a modified version of the Library.

108         

109         

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and

110         

modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a

111         

"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The

112         

former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must

113         

be combined with the library in order to run.

114         



115         

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

116         

  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

117         

118         

 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other

119         

program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or

120         

other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of

121         

this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").

122         

Each licensee is addressed as "you".

123         

124         

 A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data

125         

prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs

126         

(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

127         

128         

 The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work

129         

which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the

130         

Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under

131         

copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a

132         

portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated

133         

straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is

134         

included without limitation in the term "modification".)

135         

136         

 "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for

137         

making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means

138         

all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated

139         

interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation

140         

and installation of the library.

141         

142         

 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not

143         

covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of

144         

running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from

145         

such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based

146         

on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for

147         

writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does

148         

and what the program that uses the Library does.

149         



150         

 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's

151         

complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that

152         

you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an

153         

appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact

154         

all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any

155         

warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the

156         

Library.

157         

158         

 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,

159         

and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a

160         

fee.

161         



162         

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion

163         

of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and

164         

distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1

165         

above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

166         

167         

   a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

168         

169         

   b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices

170         

   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

171         

172         

   c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no

173         

   charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

174         

175         

   d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a

176         

   table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses

177         

   the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility

178         

   is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,

179         

   in the event an application does not supply such function or

180         

   table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of

181         

   its purpose remains meaningful.

182         

183         

   (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has

184         

   a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the

185         

   application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any

186         

   application-supplied function or table used by this function must

187         

   be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square

188         

   root function must still compute square roots.)

189         

190         

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If

191         

identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,

192         

and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in

193         

themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those

194         

sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you

195         

distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based

196         

on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of

197         

this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the

198         

entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote

199         

it.

200         

201         

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest

202         

your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to

203         

exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or

204         

collective works based on the Library.

205         

206         

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library

207         

with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of

208         

a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under

209         

the scope of this License.

210         

211         

 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public

212         

License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do

213         

this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so

214         

that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,

215         

instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the

216         

ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify

217         

that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in

218         

these notices.

219         



220         

 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for

221         

that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all

222         

subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

223         

224         

 This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of

225         

the Library into a program that is not a library.

226         

227         

 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or

228         

derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form

229         

under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany

230         

it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which

231         

must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a

232         

medium customarily used for software interchange.

233         

234         

 If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy

235         

from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the

236         

source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to

237         

distribute the source code, even though third parties are not

238         

compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

239         

240         

 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the

241         

Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or

242         

linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a

243         

work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and

244         

therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

245         

246         

 However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library

247         

creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it

248         

contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the

249         

library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.

250         

Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

251         

252         

 When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file

253         

that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a

254         

derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.

255         

Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be

256         

linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The

257         

threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

258         

259         

 If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data

260         

structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline

261         

functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object

262         

file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative

263         

work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the

264         

Library will still fall under Section 6.)

265         

266         

 Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may

267         

distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.

268         

Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,

269         

whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

270         



271         

 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or

272         

link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a

273         

work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work

274         

under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit

275         

modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse

276         

engineering for debugging such modifications.

277         

278         

 You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the

279         

Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by

280         

this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work

281         

during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the

282         

copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference

283         

directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one

284         

of these things:

285         

286         

   a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding

287         

   machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever

288         

   changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under

289         

   Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked

290         

   with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that

291         

   uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the

292         

   user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified

293         

   executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood

294         

   that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the

295         

   Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application

296         

   to use the modified definitions.)

297         

298         

   b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the

299         

   Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a

300         

   copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,

301         

   rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)

302         

   will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if

303         

   the user installs one, as long as the modified version is

304         

   interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

305         

306         

   c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at

307         

   least three years, to give the same user the materials

308         

   specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more

309         

   than the cost of performing this distribution.

310         

311         

   d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy

312         

   from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above

313         

   specified materials from the same place.

314         

315         

   e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these

316         

   materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

317         

318         

 For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the

319         

Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for

320         

reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,

321         

the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is

322         

normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major

323         

components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on

324         

which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies

325         

the executable.

326         

327         

 It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license

328         

restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally

329         

accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot

330         

use both them and the Library together in an executable that you

331         

distribute.

332         



333         

 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the

334         

Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library

335         

facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined

336         

library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on

337         

the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise

338         

permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

339         

340         

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work

341         

   based on the Library, uncombined with any other library

342         

   facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the

343         

   Sections above.

344         

345         

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact

346         

   that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining

347         

   where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

348         

349         

 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute

350         

the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any

351         

attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or

352         

distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your

353         

rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,

354         

or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses

355         

terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

356         

357         

 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not

358         

signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or

359         

distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are

360         

prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by

361         

modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the

362         

Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and

363         

all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying

364         

the Library or works based on it.

365         

366         

 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the

367         

Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the

368         

original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library

369         

subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further

370         

restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.

371         

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with

372         

this License.

373         



374         

 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent

375         

infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),

376         

conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or

377         

otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not

378         

excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot

379         

distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this

380         

License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you

381         

may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent

382         

license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by

383         

all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then

384         

the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to

385         

refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

386         

387         

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any

388         

particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,

389         

and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

390         

391         

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any

392         

patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any

393         

such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the

394         

integrity of the free software distribution system which is

395         

implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made

396         

generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed

397         

through that system in reliance on consistent application of that

398         

system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing

399         

to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot

400         

impose that choice.

401         

402         

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to

403         

be a consequence of the rest of this License.

404         

405         

 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in

406         

certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the

407         

original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add

408         

an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,

409         

so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus

410         

excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if

411         

written in the body of this License.

412         

413         

 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new

414         

versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.

415         

Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,

416         

but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

417         

418         

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library

419         

specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and

420         

"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and

421         

conditions either of that version or of any later version published by

422         

the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a

423         

license version number, you may choose any version ever published by

424         

the Free Software Foundation.

425         



426         

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free

427         

programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,

428         

write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is

429         

copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free

430         

Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our

431         

decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status

432         

of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing

433         

and reuse of software generally.

434         

435         

                NO WARRANTY

436         

437         

 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO

438         

WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

439         

EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR

440         

OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY

441         

KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE

442         

IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR

443         

PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE

444         

LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME

445         

THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

446         

447         

 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN

448         

WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY

449         

AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU

450         

FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR

451         

CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE

452         

LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING

453         

RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A

454         

FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF

455         

SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

456         

DAMAGES.

457         

458         

             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

459         



460         

          How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

461         

462         

 If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest

463         

possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that

464         

everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting

465         

redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the

466         

ordinary General Public License).

467         

468         

 To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is

469         

safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively

470         

convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the

471         

"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

472         

473         



474         

   Copyright (C)   

475         

476         

   This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or

477         

   modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public

478         

   License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either

479         

   version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

480         

481         

   This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

482         

   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

483         

   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU

484         

   Lesser General Public License for more details.

485         

486         

   You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public

487         

   License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software

488         

   Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

489         

490         

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

491         

492         

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your

493         

school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if

494         

necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

***************************************************************************

%%The following software may be included in this product:
JUnit

Use of any of this software is governed by the terms of the license below:

License for Request for Full Review #1221


Common Public License - v 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

     a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections
2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
any resulting litigation.

     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

     "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

     "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
     publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
     Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
     use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
     where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
     by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
     institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
     as of the date such litigation is filed.

  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
     Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
     modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
     meet the following conditions:

     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
         Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
         stating that You changed the files; and

     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
         attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
         the Derivative Works; and

     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
         or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
         that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
         as modifying the License.

     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
     may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
     for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
     reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
     the conditions stated in this License.

  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
     agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
     of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
